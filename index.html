        <h1>WITH THE CHILDLIKE PEOPLE</h1>
        <p>Siddhartha went to Kamaswami the merchant, he was directed into a rich house, servants led him between precious carpets into a chamber, where he awaited the master of the house. Kamaswami entered, a swiftly, smoothly moving man with very gray hair, with very intelligent, cautious eyes, with a greedy mouth. Politely, the host and the guest greeted one another. 
</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"I have been told," the merchant began, "that you were a Brahman, a learned man, but that you seek to be in the service of a merchant. Might you have become destitute, Brahman, so that you seek to serve?"</p>
            <cite>Merchant</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>"No," said Siddhartha, "I have not become destitute and have never been destitute. You should know that I'm coming from the Samanas, with whom I have lived for a long time." </p><p>"If you're coming from the Samanas, how could you be anything but destitute? Aren't the Samanas entirely without possessions?" </p>
        <h2>"I am without possessions," </h2>
        <p>"if this is what you mean. Surely, I am without possessions. But I am so voluntarily, and therefore I am not destitute." <br>
        "But what are you planning to live of, being without possessions?" <br>
"I haven't thought of this yet, sir. For more than three years, I have been without possessions, and have never thought about of what I should live." 
<br>"So you've lived of the possessions of others." 
<br>"Presumable this is how it is. After all, a merchant also lives of what other people own." 
<br>"Well said. But he wouldn't take anything from another person for nothing; he would give his merchandise in return." 
<br>"So it seems to be indeed. Everyone takes, everyone gives, such is life." 
<br>"But if you don't mind me asking: being without possessions, what would you like to give?" 
<br>"Everyone gives what he has. The warrior gives strength, the merchant gives merchandise, the teacher teachings, the farmer rice, the fisher fish." 
<br>"Yes indeed. And what is it now what you've got to give? What is it that you've learned, what you're able to do?" 
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I can think. </li>
            <li>I can wait. </li>
            <li>I can fast. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"That's everything?"</p>
        <h3>I believe, that's everything!</h3>
        <p>"And what's the use of that? For example, the fasting—what is it good for?" <br>
"It is very good, sir. When a person has nothing to eat, fasting is the smartest thing he could do. When, for example, Siddhartha hadn't learned to fast, he would have to accept any kind of service before this day is up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would force him to do so. But like this, Siddhartha can wait calmly, he knows no impatience, he knows no emergency, for a long time he can allow hunger to besiege him and can laugh about it. This, sir, is what fasting is good for." 
<br>"You're right, Samana. Wait for a moment." 
<br>Kamaswami left the room and returned with a scroll, which he handed to his guest while asking: "Can you read this?" 
<br>Siddhartha looked at the scroll, on which a sales-contract had been written down, and began to read out its contents. 
            <br>"Excellent," said Kamaswami. "And would you write something for me on this piece of paper?" <br>
He handed him a piece of paper and a pen, and Siddhartha wrote and returned the paper. 

</p>
        <h3>Writing is good, thinking is better. Being smart is good, being patient is better.</h3>
        <p>"It is excellent how you're able to write," the merchant praised him. "Many a thing we will still have to discuss with one another. For today, I'm asking you to be my guest and to live in this house." <br>
        Siddhartha thanked and accepted, and lived in the dealers house from now on. Clothes were brought to him, and shoes, and every day, a servant prepared a bath for him. Twice a day, a plentiful meal was served, but Siddhartha only ate once a day, and ate neither meat nor did he drink wine. Kamaswami told him about his trade, showed him the merchandise and storage-rooms, showed him calculations. Siddhartha got to know many new things, he heard a lot and spoke little. And thinking of Kamala's words, he was never subservient to the merchant, forced him to treat him as an equal, yes even more than an equal. Kamaswami conducted his business with care and often with passion, but Siddhartha looked upon all of this as if it was a game, the rules of which he tried hard to learn precisely, but the contents of which did not touch his heart. <br> 
            
            He was open to everything, these people brought his way. </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Welcome was the merchant</dt>
                <dd>Who offered him linen for sale</dd>
            <dt>Welcome was the debtor</dt>
                <dd>Who sought another loan</dd>
            <dt>Welcome was the beggar</dt>
                <dd>Who told him for one hour the story of his poverty and who was not half as poor as any given Samana</dd>
            </dl>
        <p>He did not treat the rich foreign merchant any different than the servant who shaved him and the street-vendor whom he let cheat him out of some small change when buying bananas. When Kamaswami came to him, to complain about his worries or to reproach him concerning his business, he listened curiously and happily, was puzzled by him, tried to understand him, consented that he was a little bit right, only as much as he considered indispensable, and turned away from him, towards the next person who would ask for him. </p>
        <h2>Not all people are smart.</h2>
        
        <p>Once, he said to her: "You are like me, you are different from most people. You are Kamala, nothing else, and inside of you, there is a peace and refuge, to which you can go at every hour of the day and be at home at yourself, as I can also do. Few people have this, and yet all could have it." </p>
        <p>"Not all people are smart," said Kamala. </p>
        <br>
        <p>At times he felt, deep in his chest, a dying, quiet voice, which admonished him quietly, lamented quietly; he hardly perceived it. And then, for an hour, he became aware of the strange life he was leading, of him doing lots of things which were only a game, of, though being happy and feeling joy at times, real life still passing him by and not touching him. As a ball-player plays with his balls, he played with his business-deals, with the people around him, watched them, found amusement in them; with his heart, with the source of his being, he was not with them. The source ran somewhere, far away from him, ran and ran invisibly, had nothing to do with his life any more. And at several times he suddenly became scared on account of such thoughts and wished that he would also be gifted with the ability to participate in all of this childlike-naive occupations of the daytime with passion and with his heart, really to live, really to act, really to enjoy and to live instead of just standing by as a spectator. But again and again, he came back to beautiful Kamala, learned the art of love, practised the cult of lust, in which more than in anything else giving and taking becomes one, chatted with her, learned from her, gave her advice, received advice. She understood him better than Govinda used to understand him, she was more similar to him. </p>
        <p>"And what's the use of that? For example, the fasting—what is it good for?" </p>
        <p><a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Everything</a>. "It is <i>very</i> good, sir. When a person has nothing to eat, fasting is the <b>smartest</b> thing he could do. When, for example, Siddhartha hadn't learned to fast, he would have to accept any kind of service before this day is up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would force him to do so. But like this, Siddhartha can wait calmly, he knows no impatience, he knows no emergency, for a long time he can allow hunger to besiege him and can laugh about it. This, sir, is what fasting is good for." </p>
        <h4>I have been told...</h4>
        <p>"I have been told," the merchant began, "that you were a Brahman, a learned man, but that you seek to be in the service of a merchant. Might you have become destitute, <em>Brahman</em>, so that you seek to serve?" </p>
        <h4>"So you've lived of the possessions of others."</h4>
        <p>"Presumable this is how it is. After all, a merchant also lives of what other people own." </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Everyone takes</li>
            <li>Everyone gives</li>
            <li>Such is life</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>What would you like to give?</h4>
        <p>"Everyone gives what he has. The warrior gives strength, the merchant gives merchandise, the teacher teachings, the farmer rice, the fisher fish."</p>
